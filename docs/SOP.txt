CatalAIst — An AI Catalyst for Clarity and Prioritisation (v3.1)



Internal Release Date: Monday, 10 November 2025

Owner: AI Accelerator Team | Master Plan Program

Press Release (Vision)



The AI Accelerator Team announces CatalAIst, a conversational AI system that helps teams quickly and objectively evaluate business-improvement initiatives.



Instead of lengthy workshops or subjective scoring, teams simply describe their ideas — by voice or text — and CatalAIst listens, interprets, and classifies them into one of six transformation categories:

Eliminate – Remove redundant or low-value activities

Simplify – Streamline steps and reduce effort

Digitise – Convert manual or offline steps into digital self-service experiences

RPA – Automate repetitive, rule-based work

AI Agent – Introduce adaptive intelligence to decisions

Agentic AI – Enable autonomous, reasoning-based systems



Using a Large Language Model (LLM) core, CatalAIst provides consistent, bias-free categorisation and speeds up the path from idea to prioritised action.

Privacy, auditability, and multilingual support are built in.



“CatalAIst helps us move faster and smarter,” said [Leader Name], AI Accelerator Lead.
“It’s a conversation, not an interrogation — an AI catalyst for clarity and prioritisation.”
1. Problem Context Snapshot



Across the organisation, hundreds of optimisation ideas and automation candidates are surfaced every year.

Some are well-documented and current; others have existed for years with ownership or context long forgotten.

Evaluating them consistently is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity.



CatalAIst is designed to make these discussions easier and smarter — enabling multiple short, conversational sessions that collectively form a decisive outcome about the true status of a process or initiative.

Instead of relying on single documents or static scoring sheets, teams can talk it through — and the system remembers, summarises, and refines insights until consensus is reached.

2. Who is it for?

AI Accelerator Team — running business-optimisation programmes

Process owners & initiative leads — who describe their workflows

Transformation leaders — who need transparent, explainable decisions

3. What problem does it solve?



Manual evaluation of initiatives is slow, inconsistent, and biased.

CatalAIst provides a consistent, conversational evaluation that classifies each initiative into one of six agreed categories (Eliminate → Agentic AI), ensuring fairness, traceability, and speed.

4. How success will be measured

Metric

Target

Agreement rate (AI vs human)

≥ 80 % initial → > 90 % after tuning

Evaluation time reduction

≥ 50 % faster per initiative

User feedback

Majority 👍 “thumbs up” rating

Audit completeness

100 % traceable rationale

5. Key Principles

Trust & Transparency — every decision explained

User Friendly — conversational, not interrogative

Usability — short flows, early exits, multilingual

Observability — all interactions logged for learning

Adaptability — reinforced learning from outcomes

6. Quotes



“It feels like the system actually listens — we just talk, and it connects the dots.” – Process Owner
“It’s a fair referee for automation ideas; we get to consensus quicker.” – AI Accelerator Analyst
“Finally, something that captures knowledge that would otherwise vanish.” – Ops Manager
7. Key Dependencies

Area

Description

Platform

Initial pilot can run using Microsoft Copilot as the chat interface (no persistent memory).

Memory layer

For sustained context across sessions, a Copilot Agent with memory (via Copilot Studio) or an AWS Bedrock-hosted agent could be engineered — subject to governance approval.

Governance & Privacy

Audit logging, anonymisation, and model explainability required before scaling.

Voice & Multilingual Support

Optional later phase (ASR/TTS or translation pipeline).

10. Transformation Categories Explained



Eliminate



Remove redundant or low-value activities that add no measurable impact or can be retired entirely.

Example: Retire a legacy monthly report no longer used by leadership.



Simplify



Streamline processes by reducing steps, dependencies, or unnecessary approvals.

Example: Combine multiple approval stages into a single auto-routed workflow.



Digitise



Convert manual, paper-based, or human-only steps into digital or self-service channels.

Example: Let customers order statements online instead of calling agents.



RPA (Robotic Process Automation)



Automate simple, rule-based and repetitive digital tasks.

Example: Automate invoice uploads or data transfers between systems.



AI Agent



Introduce adaptive intelligence to processes that require context, prediction, or decision-making.

Example: AI suggests next best action for a customer retention workflow.



Agentic AI



Implement autonomous reasoning and multi-step orchestration — where the system can plan, decide, and act independently within guardrails.

Example: An Agentic AI manages a full claims workflow end-to-end, coordinating across systems and people.

Bias in training data

Skewed outcomes

Anonymisation, audit controls, opt-in storage

13. Updated Flow Integration

Step 1: Is it necessary? → Eliminate
Step 2: Can it be simplified? → Simplify
Step 3: Is it manual and could be digital? → Digitise
Step 4: Is it rule-based and repetitive? → RPA
Step 5: Does it need intelligence or learning? → AI Agent
Step 6: Does it require reasoning or autonomy? → Agentic AI
Digitise is evaluated after Simplify and before RPA to ensure manual or human-heavy processes are digitised before automation or AI application.

14. Unique Selling Proposition (Updated)



CatalAIst is a Large Language Model–driven conversational evaluator that removes bias, accelerates categorisation, and creates audit-ready insight — turning unstructured discussions into structured, prioritised outcomes.

With the new Digitisation category, CatalAIst identifies where processes can first go digital before being automated — ensuring a logical, stepwise path from manual → digital → automated → intelligent.
