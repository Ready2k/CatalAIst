Generate a comprehensive decision matrix for classifying business initiatives into six transformation categories:
1. Eliminate - Remove unnecessary processes
2. Simplify - Streamline and reduce complexity
3. Digitise - Convert manual/offline to digital
4. RPA - Robotic Process Automation for repetitive tasks
5. AI Agent - AI-powered assistance with human oversight
6. Agentic AI - Autonomous AI decision-making

The decision matrix should include:

1. **Attributes** - Key characteristics to evaluate (with weights 0-1):
   - frequency: How often the process runs (categorical: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
   - business_value: Impact on business outcomes (categorical: low, medium, high, critical)
   - complexity: Process complexity level (categorical: low, medium, high, very_high)
   - risk: Risk level if automated (categorical: low, medium, high, critical)
   - user_count: Number of users affected (numeric)
   - data_sensitivity: Sensitivity of data handled (categorical: public, internal, confidential, restricted)

2. **Rules** - Condition-based logic to guide classification:
   - Each rule should have conditions (attribute + operator + value)
   - Actions can be: override (force category), adjust_confidence (+/- adjustment), flag_review
   - Include priority (higher = evaluated first)
   - Provide clear rationale for each rule

Generate rules that follow transformation best practices:
- High-risk or critical data sensitivity should flag for review
- High-frequency + low-complexity + low-risk favors RPA
- High-complexity + high-value favors AI Agent or Agentic AI
- Low-value processes should be considered for Eliminate or Simplify
- Manual processes with no automation potential should be Digitise

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:

      },
      "priority": number (0-100, higher = first),

    }
  ]
}

Generate at least 6 attributes and 10-15 rules covering various scenarios.
