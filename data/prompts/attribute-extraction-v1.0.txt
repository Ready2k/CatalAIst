   - Consider: revenue impact, customer satisfaction, compliance requirements

3. **complexity**: The technical and operational complexity
   - Values: "very_high", "high", "medium", "low", "very_low"
   - Consider: number of steps, systems involved, decision points, exceptions

4. **risk**: The risk level if the process fails or is changed
